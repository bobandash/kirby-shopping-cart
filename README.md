## Technologies Used:
Front-End:
- React
Backend:
- Express, Node.js
- MongoDB,
- Pug

## Quick Start
- Fork the project
- Clone the project using git clone https://github.com/bobandash/wheres-waldo.git
- Open the project using the editor of your choice
- Run npm install
- Create a database on mongoDB
- Make sure that you're current directory is on the server
- Create an .env file with your database URL (include password) with MONGODB_URL as the key
- Run "node populateDb.js" to populate the database
- Run npm run devStart to compile the server
- Make another terminal with the directory as the client and run "npm run dev"

## Concepts Learned
- This was the first big project that I used react.js for the front-end so I grew familiar with the useEffect and useState hooks
- This was also the first big project with the backend and pug
- A lot of practice with pug as a dynamic templating language

## To-Do:
If I were to come back to this project in the future, I would want to:
- Implement the sign in page and order history
- Use Stripe API to take payments (if I ever store inventory of Kirby)
- Add JSX of remaining footer links
